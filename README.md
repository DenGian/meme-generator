Visit [the website](https://dengian-meme-generator.netlify.app/) here.

This project came about because I was challenged to make a meme generator, so I did.  
I started of by thinking what stack I was going to use, but this didn't take a long time,  
since I just came off doing a lot backend, I wanted to do this in frontend.
